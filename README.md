create a custom shader assignment for CPSC-486

Description: The purpose of this project is to make sure the student understands the differences between a gouraud shader and a blinn-phong shader. The assignment provides the student with an already made program that already contains a blinn-phong shader.
The project uses glsl 1.20 which means that the use of in and out variables still did not exist and were instead called varying variables, which served much the same purpose, only being slightly missnamed in my opinion. 
At first I was dumbfounded by what I was looking at since I had no clue how a shader worked. I continued like this for a few hours until I decided that reading the book was probably my best bet. I reread chapter 2, most of the words still meant little to me. so I decided go to the professor's office to see if he could explain the subject better to me.
